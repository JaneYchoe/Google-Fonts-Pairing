            League Gothic is a revival of an old classic: Alternate Gothic. It was originally designed by Morris Fuller Bentonfor the American Type Founders Company in 1903. The League Of Moveable Type decided to make their own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement. Thanks to a commission from the fine & patient folks over at WND.com, it’s been revised and updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, Dannci and Mirko Velimirovic.

   Source® Sans Pro, Adobe's first open source typeface family, was designed by Paul D.        Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces.

            Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms.

            League Spartan is The League Of Moveable Type's interpretation of Matt Bailey's Spartan, a typeface based on early 20th century American geometric sans serifs.

            Anton is a reworking of a traditional advertising sans serif typeface. The letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont,the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers.

            Prompt in Thai means “ready,” the same as in English. Prompt is a loopless Thai and sans Latin typeface. The simple and geometric Latin was developed to work harmoniously with the loopless Thai that has wide proportions and airy negative space. It is suitable for both web and print usage, such as magazines, newspapers, and posters.
